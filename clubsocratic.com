            <h2>Our Meeting Structure</h2>
            <p>We aim for an engaging yet relaxed atmosphere. Here's what you can expect at a typical Club Socratic meeting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Welcome & Introductions (10 min):</strong> A brief opening to greet new and returning members.</li>
                <li><strong>Topic Introduction (5 min):</strong> The day's selected topic is presented, often with a brief context or framing question.</li>
                <li><strong>Facilitated Discussion (45-60 min):</strong> This is the core of our meeting. A facilitator ensures everyone gets a chance to speak, maintains a respectful tone, and guides the conversation through various viewpoints. We encourage active listening and constructive dialogue.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Discussion & Socializing (15-30 min):</strong> The formal discussion concludes, but members are encouraged to continue networking, sharing thoughts, and building connections.</li>
                <li><strong>Wrap-up & Next Steps (5 min):</strong> Announcing the next meeting details and encouraging topic submissions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our meetings are typically held bi-weekly, though specific dates and times will be announced via email. We prioritize an environment where ideas are debated, not people.</p>
